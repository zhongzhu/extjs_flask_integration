extjs_flask_integration
=======================
This sample code is to show how Ext JS and Flask can work together.
I used Sencha Architect to generate the sample project CarListing and put it under folder /static
Changed the DataStore from MemroryStore to JsonStore to fetch data from Flask app.py instead of from memrory.
